# node_backend
Creazione di un backend per App create in React Native, struttura a microservisi

## Structure
The point of this backend is to serve microservices.

Idea is to make it slim and fast as possible.

This is a copy of an older repository which I needed to delete, now is becoming the official branch

## Setup
For the correct working of the backend you need to create a .env file with the following parameters:  

> DB_CONNECTION_STRING=[postgre connection string]  
> PORT=[working Port] (this is optional, automatically will user the 3000 port)  

## Future implementations
- [ ] Support different DB
- [ ] Active use on react native app [Garnockbook](https://github.com/Lucarnosky/GarnockBook)
- [ ] Add different services except mere API and data providing (external API)
